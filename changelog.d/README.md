# Changelog fragments

Changelog entries for unreleased work live here as one file per issue, not as
edits to `CHANGELOG.md`. At release the fragments are assembled into a single
version section and deleted.

## Why fragments

Parallel work happens in one worktree per issue, so several branches are
usually open at once. If each branch appended to the `## [Unreleased]` block
at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, every branch would touch the same few lines of
the same file and nearly every pull request would conflict with every other
one.

A fragment is named after its issue, so no two branches ever write the same
file and the conflict cannot happen.

## When a change needs a fragment

The changelog serves **people who use the library**. Repo history is git's job,
and work tracking is beads' job. Neither belongs here.

Write a fragment for:

- a public API addition, change, or removal
- a change in observable behavior
- a bug fix a user could have noticed
- anything breaking

Do **not** write a fragment for:

- test harness or fixtures
- documentation, ADRs, or plans
- internal refactors with no visible effect
- quality gate, CI, or agent tooling changes

If you are unsure, ask whether someone who only ever calls the public API could
tell the difference. If not, skip it.

## Format

One file per issue, named for the beads issue ID:

    changelog.d/ece-abc.md

Contents are the Keep a Changelog section heading followed by the entry:

```markdown
### Added

- Encrypted Ecto types dump and load through the configured vault, so a field
  becomes encrypted at rest by changing its schema type and nothing else.
```

Rules:

- Use only the standard headings: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`,
  `Fixed`, `Security`, plus a bold `**Breaking**` for a breaking change.
- A breaking change goes under `### **Breaking**`, and that heading comes
  first in a section, ahead of `Added`. This is what the pre-1.0 banner in
  [README.md](../README.md) promises a reader: every breaking change recorded
  under a bold **Breaking** heading that says what to do about it.
- One line per change, present tense, describing the effect on the user.
- No nested bullets. Detail belongs in the pull request and the commit body; a
  changelog line that needs sub-points is really several changes or one that is
  over-explained.
- One file may carry more than one heading if an issue genuinely spans them.
- For a breaking change, say what to do about it, not just what broke.
- A change to the stored ciphertext or blind-index format is breaking for
  anyone with rows already written. Say what the migration is.
- A fragment marked `**Breaking**` keeps that heading when it is promoted at
  release. It is not folded into `Changed` or `Removed`, and the bold marker
  is not dropped.
- Never put key material, plaintext, or a ciphertext sample in a fragment. The
  changelog is published; the repo's rule against logging key-shaped values
  applies here too.

## At release

Assemble the fragments into a new version section in `CHANGELOG.md`, grouped by
heading and ordered `**Breaking**`, `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`,
`Fixed`, `Security`. A `**Breaking**` fragment carries its heading through the
promotion unchanged, so the version section opens with `### **Breaking**` and
keeps the sentence saying what to do about the change. Delete the fragments in
the same commit that cuts the release.

Tagging is a separate step after that commit merges, and it is the operator's:
the release prep - the version bump, the promoted `CHANGELOG.md` section, the
deleted fragments - merges on its own, and the tag and the Hex publish follow
it. Because the prep consumes every fragment its siblings wrote, it merges
LAST on its lane: a branch still holding an unmerged fragment when the prep
lands misses that release and has to wait for the next one.
